I"ñ<p>Last week o2r team member <a href="https://nordholmen.net/">Daniel</a> co-organised a workshop at the <a href="http://agile-online.org/index.php/conference/conference-2018">21st AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science</a> in Lund, Sweden.
The workshop went very well and Daniel together with his colleagues was able to spread the word about reproducible research and Open Science.
They are pretty sure they convinced some new scientists to reconsider their habits!</p>
