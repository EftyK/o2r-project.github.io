I"ý<p>Last week o2r team member <a href="https://nordholmen.net/">Daniel</a> co-organised a workshop at the <a href="http://agile-online.org/index.php/conference/conference-2018">21st AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science</a> in Lund, Sweden.
The workshop went very well and Daniel together with his colleagues was able to spread the word about reproducible research and Open Science.
They are pretty sure they convinced some new scientists to reconsider their habits!</p>

<p>Daniel wrote a short report about the workshop: <strong><a href="https://o2r.info/reproducible-agile/2018/#workshop-report">https://o2r.info/reproducible-agile/2018/#workshop-report</a></strong></p>

<p>The workshop series will probably be continued at the next AGILE conference in Limassol, Cyprus.
For o2r participating in such a workshop is a great way to stay in touch with users of reproducibility tools and practices, and to give back to the communities not only with technology but with education.</p>
