I"¯<p>The primary objective of the second phase of the project <a href="https://o2r.info">Opening Reproducible Research</a> (o2r) is <em>‚ÄúUse ERCs for actual scientific publications‚Äù</em>.
In several work packages the o2r team will implement pilots.
In <em>collaboration pilots</em>, we work with publishers on Virtual Special Issues (VSIs).
In these VSIs, submitted articles will have <a href="/results">ERCs</a> as supplemental material - an evolutionary use of ERCs.
In a <em>self-hosted pilot</em>, we want to realise a more revolutionary use of ERCs.
By extending <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/">Open Journal Systems</a> (OJS), we make the ERC the item under review in a demonstration journal.
The pilots are supported by operating infrastructure and we will support authors, reviewers, and readers to enhance their scholarly communication with ERCs.</p>

<p>Together, the three pilots cover current publication practices from large scale publishers to independent journals.
The pilots are accompanied by monitoring and user studies and thereby provide crucial data to learn about the costs and benefits of ERC-based research publications.
All pilots require the integration of o2r services and tools in existing, established IT systems and organisational workflows - <em>we thank the collaborating publishers and editors as well as all authors and editors for their participation and open-mindedness!</em></p>

<h2 id="collaboration-pilots">Collaboration pilots</h2>

<p>The diversity of the VSIs, potentially covering journals from a variety of geoscience disciplines, allows to reach the broad authorship and readership of the involved journals.
It evaluates the creation and inspection process for ERCs outside of a prototypical lab setting, so the technical infrastructure for ERCs is completely overhauled to support a growing number of users.</p>

<h2 id="self-hosted-pilot">Self-hosted pilot</h2>

<p>The self-hosted pilot replaces the traditional paper with ERCs.
It demonstrates ERCs‚Äô potential to stakeholders and provides a platform for evaluation of ERCs in education.
The self-hosted pilot will be used to investigate the impact of ERCs on understanding by preparing articles used in education as an ERC as a replacement or complement to reading material in a geoinformatics seminar.
We plan to partly replace the reading material, originally PDFs, in a MSc seminar at ifgi with ERCs and make these available in a self-hosted OJS installation featuring integration of ERCs.
The students will also make first experiences as academic authors when they submit they final project report as an ERC.</p>

<p><em>The first plans for the self-hosted pilot based on OJS are described in this blog post: <a href="https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/">https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/</a>.</em></p>
