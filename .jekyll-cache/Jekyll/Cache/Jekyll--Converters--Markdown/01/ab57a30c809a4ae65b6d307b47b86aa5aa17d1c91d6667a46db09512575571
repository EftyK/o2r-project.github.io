I"µ<p><a href="https://twitter.com/clavitolo">Claudia Vitolo</a> from the <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/">European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)</a> had the brilliant idea to host a workshop about <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/building-reproducible-workflows">building reproducible workflows for earth sciences</a>. It is not surprising that weather forecasts strongly depend on computational analyses, statistics, and data. Wait! Isnâ€™t this exactly what o2r addresses? Well observed, that is certainly correct. For this reason, we were very happy to receive an invitation from Claudia for giving a keynote. But letâ€™s start from the beginning.</p>
