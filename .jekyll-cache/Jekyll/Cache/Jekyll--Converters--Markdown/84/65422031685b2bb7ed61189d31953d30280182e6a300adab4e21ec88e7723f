I"Æ<p>Welcome to the new website of the research project <em>Opening Reproducible Research</em>.</p>

<p>You can learn the basics of the project and get to know the participants on the <a href="/about">About</a> page.</p>

<p>In short, we will develop new methods to make geosciences research reproducible. We will create open source tools and standards to compile text, data, and code (both sources and binary executables) into research compendia. These compendia will be easy to create for non-developers, executable in a web-based infrastructure, and allow exchanging of data and methods between compatible compendia.</p>

<p>You can follow our work on <a href="https://github.com/o2r-project">GitHub</a>.</p>
