I"ó<p>Reproducible research is a topic relevant for all scientific disciplines.
We in the o2r project have a continued focus on the challenges originating in the software stacks and visualialisations for the analysis of geospatial data.

In does also not mean that our approaches for improving research reproducibility and reusability can not profit from learning about challenges and solutions in other domains.</p>
