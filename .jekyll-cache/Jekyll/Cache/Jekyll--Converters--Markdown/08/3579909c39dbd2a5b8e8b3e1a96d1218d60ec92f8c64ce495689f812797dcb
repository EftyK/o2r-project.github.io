I"5<p>“Geoscientist with experience in or willingness to learn R programming for reproducible research wanted!” I had just completed a beginner course in R programming for my master’s thesis and saw my chance to further develop this knowledge and enter the geoinformatic field, also get a little away from the pure ecology of my master studies in landscape ecology. I had never before heard of the words “reproducible research”, neither heard of any reason why this topic is of importance. I took the job and worked my way in. After a couple of months I had to realize that to publish my master’s thesis (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17062025">Modelling of Urban Air Pollutant Concentrations with Artificial Neural Networks Using Novel Input Variables</a>) in an international journal, all code and data had to be made freely available to enable other researchers to fully understand and reuse my analysis. And there I was, as a landscape ecologist who believed I had nothing to do with reproducible research. Apparently it is not that simple after all.</p>
