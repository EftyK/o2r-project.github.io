I"±<p>Now that we have two more years to work on open reproducible research (see our last <a href="https://o2r.info/2019/04/15/o2r2-and-egu/">blog post</a>), there is also some space for an exchange with related projects and to explore potential new collaborations. We were thus very happy to receive an invitation from the <a href="https://conquaire.uni-bielefeld.de/about/">Conquaire</a> project at the University of Bielefeld for the workshop on <a href="https://uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/conquaire/reproducibility-workshop/">data quality and reproducibility</a> (03.04.2019). Conquaire started about the same time as o2r and strives for similar goals, i.e. assisting scholars in making their research results reproducible and reusable. The workshop was located at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in a very nice room that looked a bit like the United Nations headquarter - so it was good practice for the bigger goals we have in mind.</p>
