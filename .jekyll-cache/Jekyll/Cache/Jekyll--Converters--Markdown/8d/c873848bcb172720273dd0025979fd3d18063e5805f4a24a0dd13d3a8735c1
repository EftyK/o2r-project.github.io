I"7<p>The o2r project website’s first entry <a href="/2016/01/19/introducing-o2r/">Introducing o2r</a> was published <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=19&amp;m1=1&amp;y1=2016&amp;d2=24&amp;m2=2&amp;y2=2019">1132 days ago</a>.
Since then we’ve published short and long reports about events the o2r team participated in, advertised new scholarly publications we were lucky to have accepted in journals, and reported on results of workshops organised by o2r.
But there has also been some original content from time to time, such as the extensive articles on <a href="/2016/12/15/investigating-docker-and-R/">Docker and R</a>, which received several updates over the last years (some still pending), on the <a href="/2018/11/21/elife-sprint-integrating-stencila-and-binder/">integration of Stencila and Binder</a>, or on <a href="/2019/02/04/write-reproducible-manuscripts-for-copernicus-publications-journals/">writing reproducible articles for Copernicus Publications</a>.
These posts are a valuable output of the project, and contribute to the scholarly discussion.
Therefore, when it came to writing a report on the project’s activities and outputs, it was time to consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation">preservation</a> of the project website and blog.
The website is built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (with Markdown source files) and <a href="https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-project.github.io">hosted with GitHub pages</a>, but GitHub may disappear and Jekyll might stop working at some point.</p>
