<p>Data and software are crucial components of research.
They go well beyond the workflows one would call <em>Data Science</em> today. Only openly available building blocks can ensure transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of computer-based research outputs.
More and more researchers rely on small or large datasets and use analysis tools to analyse variables, create figures, and derive conclusions.
That is why the project Opening Reproducible Research (<a href="https://o2r.info/"><em>o2r</em></a>) implements the concept of the Executable Research Compendium (<a href="https://o2r.info/erc-spec/">ERC</a>) to capture all bits and pieces underlying a research article.
In a <a href="/pilots">pilot study</a>, we plan to connect the Open Journal Systems (<a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/">OJS</a>) with the ERC.
On the one hand this connection enables submission, review, and publishing of <a href="http://research-compendium.science/">research compendia</a> and ERC.
On the other hand while it leverages the publishing capabilities and workflow management of OJS.
We will implement this integration in form of an <a href="https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#plugins">OJS plug-in</a> so it becomes readily available for all maintainers of OJS instances.</p>
