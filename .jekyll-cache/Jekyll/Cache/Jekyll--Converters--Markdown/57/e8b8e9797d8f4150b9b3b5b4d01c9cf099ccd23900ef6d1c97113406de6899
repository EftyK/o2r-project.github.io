I"<p>The capabilities of containerisation and the concept of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1045/january2017-nuest">Executable Research Compendium</a> form the basis for o2r’s <a href="https://o2r.info/results/">reproducibility service</a>.
But the demonstration how latest technology may support a more open and transparent scholarly publication alone is only one half the battle.
Breakthroughs in tools and infrastructure must be accompanied by outreach activities to highlight the need for opening reproducible research to all stakeholders (scientists, editors, publishers, funding agencies).
That is why I was extremely glad to join some of the most renowned researchers of geography and GI Science at the <a href="https://sgsup.asu.edu/sparc/RRWorkshop">“Replicability and Reproducibility Workshop”</a> in Tempe, Arizona, on February 11 and 12, 2019.
The event was organised by the Spatial Analysis Research Center (<a href="https://sgsup.asu.edu/SPARC">SPARC</a>) at Arizona State University (<a href="https://www.asu.edu/">ASU</a>).</p>
