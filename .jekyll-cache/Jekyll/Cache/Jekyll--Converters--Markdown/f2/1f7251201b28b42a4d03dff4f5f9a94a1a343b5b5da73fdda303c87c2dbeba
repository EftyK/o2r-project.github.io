<p>Markus has been a core o2r team member since the project‚Äôs start in January 2016.
He lead<!--more--> the development of the user interface for creating and examing reproducible research and conducted comprehensive reproduction studies as well as several user studies and surveys, successfully connecting the o2r project with the needs of the geoscience communities.
<a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=zlyQYmwAAAAJ&amp;hl=de&amp;oi=ao">His</a> <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6651-0976">work</a> contributes great insights on the technical and individual challenges - the status quo in the geosciences - as well as incentives and solutions for making research more open and reproducible.
His concept and implementation of <em>bindings</em> demonstrate a novel groundbreaking method for exposing the true core and value of research outputs that reach beyond geoscience applications and impact transparency, understandability, and discoverability.
Markus is a welcome <a href="https://o2r.info/publications/#talks-1">advocator and speaker</a> on reproducible research in the geosciences at local and international events.
The o2r project is fortunate that he will continue to take down barriers for openness and reproducibility and push towards better science.</p>
