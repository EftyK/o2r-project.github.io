I"<p>The o2r project has its primary goals in providing tools to enhance scholarly communication.
We build technology to help solving relevant problems.
With the Executable Research Compendium and supporting software, we provide a different, more holistic take on how research output should look like in the future, especially if data and software are involved in the scientific workflow.
However, tech is not all we do and o2r team members actively work with the GIScience community and the broader scientific community.
This blog post briefly introduces two recent collaborations that are less about technology and more about community, culture, and people.
