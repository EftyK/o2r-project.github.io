I"?<p>A few months ago, o2r team member <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6651-0976">Markus</a> published the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2018.1512421">“In-depth examination of spatiotemporal figures in open reproducible research”</a> in the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tcag20/current">Cartography and Geographic Information science</a>.
