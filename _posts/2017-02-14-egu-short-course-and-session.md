The short course **Reproducible computational research in the publication cycle** (SC81) at the [EGU general assembly](http://www.egu2017.eu/) was accepted by the short course programme group and scheduled **Monday, April 24th, 2017** in the afternoon. Thanks!

We are grateful for the change to share our work on reproducible research together with members of the [ReproZip](https://www.reprozip.org/) team in a practical, hands-on short course.
Afterwards we welcome a number of esteemed speakers to share their views <!--more-->on reproducibility as researcher, reviewer, editor, publisher, and preservationist.

See the [full session description](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2017/session/25726) in the EGU programme.

Earlier this year we also announced a [call for a session on reproducibility at EGU general assembly](/2016/11/09/egu-ga-session-call/).
The contributions to this session was merged with other sessions to create the session **IE2.4/ESSI3.10 Open Data, Reproducible Research, and Open Science**, see [session description in the EGU GA programme](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2017/session/23924).

The session programme will be published March 1st, 2017, so stay tuned for the official announcements.
