We are excited to announce a series of interactive workshops about the reproducibility of geographical maps!
We are looking for participants with different backgrounds and application domains who work with maps. At the workshop we will jointly analyse several example maps and discuss questions such as when can a map be considered as reproducible or which factors affect this decision.

Each workshop will take about two hours and will take place online during the first half of July. Several dates will be offered during that timeframe.

If you are interested in participating in one of the workshops, please get in touch with eftychia.koukouraki@uni-muenster.de.
