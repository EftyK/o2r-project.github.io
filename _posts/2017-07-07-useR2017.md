This o2r team members [Daniel](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0024-5046) and [Edzer](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8049-7069) had the pleasure to participate in the largest conference of R developers and users, [useR!2017](https://ser2017.brussels/) in Br端ssels, Belgium.

Daniel presented a new R extension package, [<code>containerit</code>](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit/), in the _Data reproducibility_ session.
It can <!--more-->automatically create a container manifest, i.e. a Dockerfile, from different sources, such as sessions or scripts.

If you want to learn more about <code>containerit</code>, read [this blog post](http://o2r.info/2017/05/30/containerit-package/) and take a look at Daniel's presentation (also on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.824006)).

Fortunately the presentation was very well-attended and assured our understanding that the importance of reproducibility is wide-spread in the R community.
The interest in using containers for this challenge is growing, as shown by the numerous questions Daniel received after the session and the remainder of the conference.

<code>containerit</code> is Open Source Software and we invite you to [try it out](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit/blob/master/README.md), [inform us about bugs](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit/issues/new),and even [participate in the development](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit/projects/1).
In the near future, we will use the package to automatically create [Executable Research Compendia](https://doi.org/10.1045/january2017-nuest) in our [reproducibility service](http://o2r.info/architecture), but the package also has an [independent roadmap](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit/projects/1) and it hopefully proves useful for many useRs outside of our project.

The workshop presentations were recorded and are published [on Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference), including [Daniel's talk](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/Automatically-archiving-reproducible-studies-with-Docker):
