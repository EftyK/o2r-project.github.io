We are happy to announce that a pre-conference workshop ["Reproducible Computational Geosciences"](https://o2r.info/agile-2017/) at the [20th AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science](https://agile-online.org/index.php/home-2017) will be held on May 9 2017 in Wageningen, The Netherlands.

With this half day workshop we want to introduce the topic of reproducible research to the AGILE conference series, the most prominent and long-standing GIScience and GIS conference in Europe.
The 3-day conference is accompanied by [_13_ workshops on diverse topics](https://agile-online.org/index.php/programme-2017/agile-workshops-2017).

*Submit your abstract [here](https://o2r.info/agile-2017/)* and share your experiences in reproducibility of geospatial analysis. Challenges, reproducibility studies, archiving, educational or legal aspects are among the welcomed topics.

The workshop is co-organized by o2r team members and Frank Osterman from ITC, Enschede. Contributions and a public peer review are done via GitHub and supported by a great programme committee of distinguished researchers. _Please share this information with potentially interested parties (and [retweet](https://twitter.com/o2r_project/status/811967235082293248)).
