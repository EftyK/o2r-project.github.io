## Specifications & documentation

o2r is an open project, so all our components are openly developed [on GitHub]({{ site.github.org }}). The project's findings manifest themselves in the following core specifications and documents, all of which are under development.

- **[ERC specification](http://o2r.info/erc-spec)** ([source](https://github.com/o2r-project/erc-spec)) formally defines the Executable Research Compendium and provides some background.
- **[Architecture](http://o2r.info/architecture/)** ([source](https://github.com/o2r-project/architecture)) describes multiple levels of architecture, from the relation of our reprocibility service with other platforms down to internal microservices.
- **[Web API](http://o2r.info/o2r-web-api/)** ([source](https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-web-api)) defines a RESTful API for our reproducibility service, also used by our platform client.

## Implementation & demo

We develop a reference implementation of the mentioned specification as Open Source software on GitHub: **[{{ site.github.org }}]({{ site.github.org }})**

**Try the online demo at [https://o2r.uni-muenster.de](https://o2r.uni-muenster.de)**

**Try it out [on your computer](/2017/10/31/reference-implementation/)**

(After logging in with your ORCID, please [get in touch](mailto:daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de) so that we can give your account the required rights.)

The **web API endpoint** is [<code>https://o2r.uni-muenster.de/api/v1/</code>](https://o2r.uni-muenster.de/api/v1/).
