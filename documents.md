## Specifications & documentation

o2r is an open project, so all our components are openly developed [on GitHub]({{ site.github.org }}). The project's findings manifest themselves in the following core specifications and documents, all of which are under development.

- **[ERC specification](https://o2r.info/erc-spec)** ([source](https://github.com/o2r-project/erc-spec)) formally defines the Executable Research Compendium and provides some background.
- **[Architecture](https://o2r.info/architecture/)** ([source](https://github.com/o2r-project/architecture)) describes multiple levels of architecture, from the relation of our reprocibility service with other platforms down to internal microservices.
- **[Web API](https://o2r.info/api/)** ([source](https://github.com/o2r-project/api)) defines a RESTful API for our reproducibility service, also used by our platform client.
