The primary objective of the second phase of the project [Opening Reproducible Research](https://o2r.info) (o2r) is _"Use ERCs for actual scientific publications"_.
In several work packages the o2r team will implement pilots.
In _collaboration pilots_, we work with publishers on Virtual Special Issues (VSIs).
In these VSIs, submitted articles will have [ERCs](/results) as supplemental material - an evolutionary use of ERCs.
In a _self-hosted pilot_, we want to realise a more revolutionary use of ERCs.
By extending [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) (OJS), we make the ERC the item under review in a demonstration journal.
The pilots are supported by operating infrastructure and we will support authors, reviewers, and readers to enhance their scholarly communication with ERCs.

## Collaboration pilots

The diversity of the VSIs, potentially covering journals from a variety of geoscience disciplines, allows to reach the broad authorship and readership of the involved journals.
It evaluates the creation and inspection process for ERCs outside of a prototypical lab setting, so the technical infrastructure for ERCs is completely overhauled to support a growing number of users.

#### Information for authors

We are developing author guidelines for creating ERCs and are setting up a support infrastructure.
Until then, the [ERC specification](https://o2r.info/erc-spec/) gives you an impression of the technical details, and the [demo server](https://o2r.uni-muenster.de/) let's you try out the current software prototype.

If you have any questions you can contact us in different ways:

- Ask a question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) using the tag [`erc`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/erc) or [`executable-research-compendium`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/executable-research-compendium).
- Send us an email to **[o2r.team@uni-muenster.de](mailto:o2r.team@uni-muenster.de)** if you have specific questions you prefer not to share publicly.
- Join our [public pilots chat room](https://gitter.im/o2r-project/pilots) on Gitter: [![Gitter]( {{ 'public/images/gitter-pilots.svg' | absolute_url }})](https://gitter.im/o2r-project/pilots)

## Self-hosted pilot

The self-hosted pilot replaces the traditional paper with ERCs.
It demonstrates ERCsâ€™ potential to stakeholders and provides a platform for evaluation of ERCs in education.
The three pilots cover current publication practices from large scale publishers to independent journals.
All pilots require the integration of o2r services and tools in existing, established IT systems and organisational workflows.
The pilots are accompanied by monitoring and user studies.
_The pilots will provide crucial data to learn about the costs and benefits of ERC-based research publications._

#### We are open for collaborations with OJS journals
<a name="ojs">

The first plans for the self-hosted pilot based on OJS are described in this blog post: [https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/](https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/)

The self-hosted pilot will be used to investigate the impact of ERCs on understanding by preparing articles used in education as an ERC as a replacement or complement to reading material in a geoinformatics seminar.

_We are looking for feedback on these plans and are open for collaboration with OJS developers and OJS journal maintainers who are interested in enhanced reviews and publications powered by ERC on OJS._
