The first objective of the second phase of Opening Reproducible Research (o2r) is _"Use ERCs for actual scientific publications"_.
In several work packages the o2r team will (a) implement pilots, both collaborating with publishers on Virtual Special Issues (VSIs) with [ERCs](/results) as supplemental material to real research manuscripts and by extending Open Source journal software to make the ERC the item under review in a demonstration journal, and (b) operate infrastructure and support authors, reviewers, and readers to engage with ERCs.

The diversity of the VSIs, potentially covering journals from a variety of geoscience disciplines, allows to reach the broad authorship and readership of the involved journals.
It evaluates the creation and inspection process for ERCs outside of a prototypical lab setting, so the technical infrastructure for ERCs is completely overhauled to support a growing number of users.

The self-hosted pilot replaces the traditional paper with ERCs.
It demonstrates ERCsâ€™ potential to stakeholders and provides a platform for evaluation of ERCs in education.
The three pilots cover current publication practices from large scale publishers to independent journals.
All pilots require the integration of o2r services and tools in existing, established IT systems and organisational workflows.
The pilots are accompanied by monitoring and user studies.
_The pilots will provide crucial data to learn about the costs and benefits of ERC-based research publications._

### We are looking for journals to participate in the Copernicus Publications Virtual Special Issue
