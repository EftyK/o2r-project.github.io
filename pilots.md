The primary objective of the second phase of the project [Opening Reproducible Research](https://o2r.info) (o2r) is _"Use ERCs for actual scientific publications"_.
In several work packages the o2r team will implement pilots.
In _collaboration pilots_, we work with publishers on Virtual Special Issues (VSIs).
In these VSIs, submitted articles will have [ERCs](/results) as supplemental material - an evolutionary use of ERCs.
In a _self-hosted pilot_, we want to realise a more revolutionary use of ERCs.
By extending [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) (OJS), we make the ERC the item under review in a demonstration journal.
The pilots are supported by operating infrastructure and we will support authors, reviewers, and readers to enhance their scholarly communication with ERCs.

Together, the three pilots cover current publication practices from large scale publishers to independent journals.
The pilots are accompanied by monitoring and user studies and thereby provide crucial data to learn about the costs and benefits of ERC-based research publications.
All pilots require the integration of o2r services and tools in existing, established IT systems and organisational workflows - _we thank the collaborating publishers and editors as well as all authors and editors for their participation and open-mindedness!_

## Collaboration pilots

The diversity of the VSIs, potentially covering journals from a variety of geoscience disciplines, allows to reach the broad authorship and readership of the involved journals.
It evaluates the creation and inspection process for ERCs outside of a prototypical lab setting, so the technical infrastructure for ERCs is completely overhauled to support a growing number of users.

### Copernicus Publications Virtual Special Issue
<a name="copernicus">

**Status:** First review started with loose integration or ERC (communication of ERC URL via coverletter and handling editor)

**Participating journals:**

- [ESSD](https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/)

**Next steps:**

- _We are looking for more Copernicus journals to participate in the virtual special issue!_ See the [Open Call for Participation in Virtual Special Issue for Reproducible Research](/public/download/o2r-vsi_editors-wanted_EGU2019.pdf).
- Integration of ERC form field to submission forms and adding of extra reviewer questions to the review form.
- Direct display of ERCs from the article reading page.

### Elsevier virtual special issue
<a name="elsevier">

**Status:** Looking for collaborating journals

See the [informative leaflet for a virtual special issue for Elsevier journals based on containers and R](/public/download/o2r-vsi_elsevier-pilot.pdf).

## Self-hosted pilot

The self-hosted pilot replaces the traditional paper with ERCs.
It demonstrates ERCs' potential to stakeholders and provides a platform for evaluation of ERCs in education.
The self-hosted pilot will be used to investigate the impact of ERCs on understanding by preparing articles used in education as an ERC as a replacement or complement to reading material in a geoinformatics seminar.
We plan to partly replace the reading material, originally PDFs, in a MSc seminar at ifgi with ERCs and make these available in a self-hosted OJS installation featuring integration of ERCs.
The students will also make first experiences as academic authors when they submit they final project report as an ERC.

_The first plans for the self-hosted pilot based on OJS are described in this blog post: [https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/](https://o2r.info/2019/10/15/Opening-Reproducible-Research-with-OJS/)._

#### üëâ We are open for collaborations with OJS journals
<a name="ojs">

_We are looking for feedback on these plans and are open for collaboration with OJS developers and OJS journal maintainers who are interested in enhanced reviews and publications powered by ERC on OJS._
