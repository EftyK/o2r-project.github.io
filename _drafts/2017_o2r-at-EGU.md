Last week the largest European geosciences conference of the year took place in Vienna: the [European Geophysical Union General Assembly 2017][egu2017].

o2r took part by co-organising a [workshop on reproducible research](http://o2r.info/2017/05/03/egu-short-course-recap/) and co-convening the session [_IE2.4/ESSI3.10 Open Data, Reproducible Research, and Open Science_][postersession].

o2r team member [Daniel NÃ¼st](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0024-5046) presented the abstract [*"Executable research compendia in geoscience research infrastructures"*][abstractpdfdaniel] ([download poster][posterdaniel]) and supported [Marius Appel](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5281-3896) in his work on ["Reproducible Earth observation analytics: challenges, ideas, and a study case on containerized land use change detection"][abstractpdfmarius] in the ESSI3.10's poster session.

It was a great experience to get to know fellow scientists who are also interested in, and worried about, reproducibility of scholarly works.
We also got useful feedback on our practical work and are encouraged again to continue spreading the word on the general topic of reproducibility alongside our research.
