The Open Access movement has created the foundation for research reproducibility in that it has greatly advanced the accessibility of research data and text. This year's theme for the [International Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org/) is “Open in Action”. The o2r-team has joined in by creating [local awareness](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Publizieren/open-access/) for what may come beyond Open Access.

To transform access into action, the o2r team is working towards the implementation of a simple technical solution. A button with ["one click reproduce"](http://pebesma.staff.ifgi.de/epic.pdf) functionality looks like an extreme point within the continuum of reproducibility at the first glance. It enables the user to recreate the original results of a study with only a mouse click. In order to realize that, a new format for the publication of research findings has to be created and integrated into the publication cycle. In o2r we envision a container format that implements Executable Research Compendia ([ERCs](http://presentations.copernicus.org/EGU2016-7396_presentation.pdf) to encapsulate any information relevant to constitutating a complete set of research data, code, text and UI. This includes any necessary specifics of the related working and run time environments. 

At the lower end of the continuum of reproducibility we find examples of published code and data that are openly accessible and yet fail to be rebuild easily by other researchers. Dependent on other software, packages and specific environments such examples leave it to the user to reconstruct the individual computational dependency architectures. This strongly increases the efforts to rebuild and run or compile the code and thus effectively blocks *Open Action*. With the use of ERCs such requirements can be resolved: The orginial analysis underlying a scientific publication becomes fully reproducible for independent researchers and anyone interested in that research. Opening reproducibility is where we see Open Action most necessary in science.
