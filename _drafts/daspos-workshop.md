A few weeks ago, o2r team member [Daniel](http://nordholmen.net) participated in a workshop organized by the project "Data and Software Preservation Open Science" ([DASPOS](https://daspos.crc.nd.edu)) at the University of Notre Dame, USA. It was organized in an excellent fashion and in perfect amenities by the Center for Research Computing ([CRC](https://crc.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame.

The workshop title "Container Strategies for Data & Software Preservation that Promote Open Science" fits perfectly with our own project goals, so Daniel was not suprised to find a very diverse group (mostly from the US) of researchers and librarians presenting on different topics, almost all of which had one connection or another with o2r.

The general connecting feature between all participants were (Docker) containers and the interest in preservervation. Different approaches were presented in hands-on sessions, namely ReproZip, Umbrella and the NDS Dashboard. You can check the [full schedule and participant list](https://daspos.crc.nd.edu/index.php/workshops/container-strategies-for-data-software-preservation-that-promote-open-science) for details.

A few highlights from Daniel's perspective:

- 


- common language and terms needed
- diversity is good, and a certain amount of re-doing existing "features" is unavoidable



You can find [his presentation](https://osf.io/h2u6w/), as well as [all other's slides and other (reading) material](https://osf.io/y9mpx/), on the Open Science Framework website. The presentations were filmed, so we will update this post as soon as the videos are made available.

Daniel would like to thank the DASPOS team ... videos ... transcript ...
