Getting user input and evaluating our ideas is a crucial part of the project. Therefore, starting today, we run an **[online questionnaire][surveylink]** investigating user interaction in the context of reproducible research. The survey is also advertised [this week at EGU]({% post_url 2016-04-08-o2r-at-EGU %}).

Please take a few minutes to help understand reproducibility in geoscience research by participating in the [first o2r survey][surveylink].
