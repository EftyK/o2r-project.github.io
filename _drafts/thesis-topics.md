o2r works on the edge of current information technology and tries to contribute to the way that research and publications are handled in the future. To achieve the ambitions goals, we have published a collection of thesis topics for both Bachlor (B.Sc.) and Master (M.Sc.) students on the [ifgi thesis page](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/Studies/thesis/index.php) ([english](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/Studies/thesis/index.php)). The German and English titles are as follows:

* _100 Euro Reproducible Research Box_, or "Reproduzierbare Forschung in Ziegelsteingröße" (B.Sc.)
* _This could also be interesting for you_, or "Das könnte Sie auch interessieren" (B.Sc. & M.Sc.)
* _Automatic creation of interactive UI widgets for scientific publications_, or "Automatische Erstellung interaktiver Benutzeroberflächen von wissenschaftlichen Publikation" (B.Sc. & M.Sc.)
* _Assistants for reproducible research_, a.k.a. "Assistenten zur Erstellung reproduzierbarer wissenschaftlicher Publikationen" (B.Sc.)


All B.Sc. thesis can be written in either English or German. More topics will follow.
