In the project, we have discussed extensively what reproducibility means (and a blogpost is planned on our view) and what we envision a reproducible paper to allow us to do (another pending blog post). A crucial aspect to further develop these ideas for us are practical evaluations, which is where **you** come into the picture.

_Do you have an almost, or even completely, reproducible paper?_

We are looking for scientific publications that we can use to test our approach. While we have been in touch with former and current colleagues and collaborators, we would like to reach beyond our immediate circles to ensure that our "test corpus" of publications covers a certain breadth of topics, data formats, used tooles/packages et cetera.

*What are we looking for?*

- Published open access journal article (ideally peer reviewed)
- Data, text, and scripts/code are openly available
  - data size < 1 GB
  - code or main script in [R](http://r-project.org/)
  - data, methodology or visualisations have a spatial or spatio-temporal component, or other "geo" aspect
- Interest in open and reproducible research and willing to engage in a dialog with the o2r team

*What do you get?*

- Your paper will become part of our test publication corpus
- _We_ will work hard to make it reproducible _for you_
- In the long run, you contributed to a process that intends to make the creation of a reproducible publication a piece of cake, for you and for your fellow scientists

**But I neither need nor want your help!**

If your paper is written in [Sweave](https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/) or [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and accompanied by an R package with the data and code, then you are on track for a reproducible workflow. _Congratulations!_ But we don't just want such apparently simply cases. We are also well aware that journals might ask for very different looking submissions, even if authors would like to use these kind of literate programming solutions.

Instead we actually look forward to work with _your workspace directory_ as it is_ to learn more about people's workflows and practices, be they good, bad, or just pragmatic. Trust us that you are not the only one for whom living up to his/her standards as well as knowledge is a challenge in day-to-day research.

*This is an open call*

Please forward this website to any of your colleagues who might fit the profile, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions. Thank you in advance!
