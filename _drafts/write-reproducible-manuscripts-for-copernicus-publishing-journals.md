_[This article is cross posted-on the [EGU GeoLog]().]_

Contemporary science faces challenges due to increased usage of data & digital technologies and heightened demands of scholarly communication.
These challenges have led to widespread [calls](#munafo) for more research transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility from the science community.
This article presents current findings and solutions, including recent new software that makes writing submission-ready manuscripts for journals of _[Copernicus Publications](https://www.copernicus.org/)_ a lot easier.
<!--more-->
While it can be debated if science really faces a [reproducibility](#baker) [crisis](#fanelli), the challenges of computer-based research have sparked numerous articles on new [good](#wilson) [research](#gil) [practices](#sandve) and their [evaluation](#hardwicke).
The challenges have also driven researchers to develop infrastructure and tools to help scientists effectively write articles, publish data & code for computations, and communicate their findings in a reproducible way, for example [Jupyter](#jupyter), [ReproZip](#reprozip) and [research compendia](https://research-compendium.science/).

[Recent](#konkol) [studies](#nuest) [showed](#ostermann) that the geosciences and geographic information science are not beyond issues with reproducibility, just like other domains.
Therefore, more and more [journals](https://www.nature.com/authors/policies/availability.html) have [adopted policies](#stodden) on sharing data and code.
However, it is equally important that scientists foster an [open research culture](#nosek) and teach researchers how they adopt more transparent and reproducible workflows, for example at skill-building workshops at conferences offered by fellow researchers, such as the EGU short courses, community-led non-profit organisations such as the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [open courses for students](#toelch), small discussion groups at research labs, or individual efforts of self-learning.
In the light of prevailing [issues of a common definition](#barba) of reproducibility, [Philip Stark](#stark), a statistics professor and associate dean of mathematical and physical sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, recently coined the term [_preproducibility_](#stark): _"An experiment or analysis is preproducible if it has been described in adequate detail for others to undertake it."_
The neologism intends to reduce confusion and also to embrace a positive attitude for more openness, honesty, and helpfulness in scholarly communication processes.

In the spirit of these activities, this article describes a modern workflow made possible by recent software releases.
The new features allow the EGU community to write preproducible manuscripts for submission to the large variety of academic journals published by [_Copernicus Publications_](https://www.copernicus.org/).
The new workflow might require hard-earned adjustments for some researchers, but it pays off because of an increase in transparency and effectivity.
This is especially the case for early career scientists.
An open and reproducible workflow enables researchers to build on others' and own previous work and better collaborate on solving the societal challenges of today.

## Reproducible research manuscripts

[Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) digital [notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05492), which [interweave data and code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) and can be exported to different output formats such as PDF for reading, are powerful means to improve transparency and preproducibility of research.
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Stencila](http://stenci.la/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) let researchers combine long-form text of a publication and source code for analysis & visualisation in a single document.
Having text and code side-by-side makes them easier to grasp and ensures consistency, because each rendering of the document executes the whole workflow using the original data.
Caching for long-lasting computations is possible, and researchers working with supercomputing infrastructures or huge datasets may limit the executed code to purposes of visualisation using processed data as input.
Authors can transparently expose specific code snippets to readers but also publish the complete source code of the document openly for collaboration and review.

The popular notebook formats are plain text-based, like [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) in case of R Markdown.
Therefore an R Markdown document can be managed with [version control software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which are programs for managing multiple versions and contributions, even by different people, to the same documents.
Version control provide traceability of authorship, a time machine for going back to any previous "working" version, and online collaboration such as on [GitLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab).
This kind of workflow also stops [the madness of using file names for versions](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531) yet still lets authors use [awesome file names](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) and apply domain-specific [guidelines for packaging research](#marwick).

R Markdown supports [different programming languages](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-5.html) besides the popular namesake [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and is a sensible solution even if you do not analyse data with scripts nor have any code in your scholarly manuscript.
It is easy to write, allows you to [manage your bibliography](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) effectively, can be used for websites, [books](https://bookdown.org/) or [blogs](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), but most importantly _it does not fall short when it is time to submit a manuscript article to a journal_.

The [`rticles`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rticles) extension package for R provides a number of templates for popular journals and publishers.
Since version `0.6` ([published Oct 9 2018](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/releases/tag/v0.6)) these [templates include](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/pull/172) the [Copernicus Publications Manuscript preparations guidelines for authors](https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html).
The Copernicus Publications staff was kind enough to give a test document a quick review and all seems in order, though of course any problems and questions shall be directed to the software's vibrant community and not the publishers.

The following code snippet and screen shot demonstrate the workflow.
Lines starting with `#` are code comments and explain the steps.
Code examples provided here are ready to use and only lack the installation commands for required packages.

~~~
# load required R extension packages:
library("rticles")
library("rmarkdown")

# create a new document using a template:
rmarkdown::draft(file = "MyArticle.Rmd",
                 template = "copernicus_article",
                 package = "rticles", edit = FALSE)

# render the source of the document to the default output format:
rmarkdown::render(input = "MyArticle/MyArticle.Rmd")
~~~
{: .language-r}

![](/public/images/2018-10_rmd-pdf-example.png)

The commands created a directory with the Copernicus Publications template's files, including an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file ready to be edited by you (left-hand side of the screenshot), a [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) (`.tex`) file for submission to the publisher, and a `.pdf` file for inspecting the final results and sharing with your colleagues (right hand side of the screenshot).
You can see how simple it is to format text, insert citations, chemical formulas, or equations, and add figures, and how they are rendered into a high-quality output file.

All of these steps may also be completed with user-friendly forms when using [RStudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio), a popular development and authoring environment available for all operating systems.
The left hand side of the following screenshot shows the form for creating a new document based on a template, and the right-hand shows side the menu for rendering, called "knitting" with R Markdown because code and text are combined into one document like threads in a garment.

![](/public/images/2018-10_rstudio-ui-example.png)

And in case you decide last minute to submit to a different journal, [`rticles` supports many publishers](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles#overview) so you only have to adjust the template while the whole content stays the same.

## Sustainable access to supplemental data

Scholarly articles receive a digital object identifier ([DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)) for long-term identification and availability.
However, a DOI is not suitable for direct data access, since it points to a [landing](https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214669863-Your-landing-page) [page](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-doi-display-guidelines#section-applying-the-guidelines) about the identified object designed to be read by humans but not by computers.
The R package [`suppdata`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=suppdata) [closes this gap](#pearse).
It supports downloading supplemental information using the article DOI, and in the latest version the [supported publishers](https://github.com/ropensci/suppdata#supported-publishers-and-repositories) include Copernicus Publications.

The following example code downloads a data file for the article ["Divergence of seafloor elevation and sea level rise in coral reef ecosystems"](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-1739-2017) by Yates et al. published in _Biogeosciences_ in 2017.

~~~
# load required R extension package:
library("suppdata")

# download a specific supplemental information (SI) file
# for an article using the article's DOI:
csv_file <- suppdata::suppdata(
  x = "10.5194/bg-14-1739-2017",
  si = "Table S1 v2 UFK FOR_PUBLICATION.csv")
supplemental
# read the data and plot it (toy example!):
my_data <- read.csv(file = csv_file, skip = 3)
plot(x = my_data$NAVD88_G03, y = my_data$RASTERVALU,
     xlab = "Historical elevation (NAVD88 GEOID03))",
     ylab = "LiDAR elevation (NAVD88 GEOID03)",
     main = "A data plot for article 10.5194/bg-14-1739-2017",
     pch = 20, cex = 0.5)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<!--
png(file = "public/images/2018-10_suppdata-example-plot.png", width = 512, height = 512, bg = "white")
plot(x = my_data$NAVD88_G03, y = my_data$RASTERVALU,
  xlab = "Historical elevation (NAVD88 GEOID03))",
  ylab = "LiDAR elevation (NAVD88 GEOID03)",
  main = "A silly plot for article 10.5194/bg-14-1739-2017",
  pch = 20, cex = 0.5)
dev.off()
-->

![](/public/images/2018-10_suppdata-example-plot.png)

You can even use this approach in sample code within your paper to make reproductions by reviewers and readers easy and stable, because a publisher can [mint](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/zentrum/locations/bibliothek/dokumentationhaupt/veroeffentlichungsverzeichnis-kopie/doi-vergabe_en.html) a DOI before publication and it will always stay the same.

## Main takeaways

Authoring submission-ready manuscripts for journals of Copernicus Publications just got a lot easier.
Everybody who can write manuscripts with a word processor can learn quickly R Markdown and benefit from a preproducible data science workflow.
Digital notebooks not only improve day-to-day research habits, but are suitable for authoring high-quality scholarly manuscripts and graphics.
The interaction with the publisher is smooth thanks to the LaTeX submission format, but you never have to write any LaTeX.
The workflow is based on an established [Free and Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open-Source_Software) software stack and embraces the principles of [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) practices.
The software is maintained by an active, growing, and welcoming community of researchers and developers with a [strong connection](https://www.r-spatial.org/) to the geospatial sciences.
Because of the complete and consistent notebook, [you](#markowetz), a colleague, or a student can easily pick up the work at a later time.
The road to effective & transparent research begins with a first step - [take it](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/repro-papers/)!
