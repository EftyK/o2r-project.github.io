In the project, we have discussed extensively what reproducibility means. We debated what a reproducible paper should allow us to do. A crucial aspect to further develop these ideas for us are practical evaluations. That is where **you** come into the picture.

_Do you have an almost reproducible paper?_

We are looking for scientific publications that we can use to test our approach. We have been in touch with former and current colleagues and collaborators, but we would like to reach beyond our immediate circles. Our "test corpus" of publications must cover a certain breadth of topics, data formats, used tooles/packages et cetera.

*What are we looking for?*

- Published open access journal article (peer reviewed)
- Data, text, and scripts/code are available publicly
  - data size < 1 GB
  - code or main script in [R](http://www.r-project.org/)
  - data, method or visualisations have a spatial or spatio-temporal component, or other "geo" aspect
- Interest in open and reproducible research and willing to engage in a dialog with the o2r team

*What do you get?*

- Your paper will become part of our test publication corpus
- _We_ will work hard to make it reproducible _for you_
- In the long run, you contributed to a process that intends to make the creation of a reproducible publication a piece of cake, for you and for your fellow scientists

**But I neither need nor want your help!**

You write your papers in [Sweave](https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/) or [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and ammend them with an R package including the data and code? Then you are on track for a reproducible workflow. _Congratulations!_ But we don't just want such apparently simple cases. We are well aware that journals might ask for very different looking submissions, even if authors want to use literate programming solutions.

Instead we look forward to work with _your workspace directory as it is_. This way we learn more about people's workflows and practices, be they good, bad, or just pragmatic. Trust us that you are not the only one for whom living up to her/his standards and expertise is a challenge in day-to-day research.

*This is an open call*

Please forward this website to any of your colleagues who might fit the profile, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions. Thank you in advance!
