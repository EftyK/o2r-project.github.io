This is the project website of the DFG-funded research project "Opening Reproducible Research" by Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi) and University and Regional Library (ULB), University of MÃ¼nster, Germany

The design is base on [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by Mark Otto.

## Building the site

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/poole/poole) for Poole to install the required software. Then run the site locally with

```
jekyll serve
```

## Useful stuff

We use the kramdown parser engine and subsequently can use some advanced syntax (e.g. for named lists, image resizing, quotes, and more). See http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html.

*Note:* When the rendering engine changes, these changes are prone to break.
